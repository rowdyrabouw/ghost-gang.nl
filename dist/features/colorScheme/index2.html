        <h2>Inspired by Pizza</h2>
        <p>
          Pac-Man was created by Japanese designer Toru Iwatani and released by
          Namco in Japan in 1980, quickly becoming a global phenomenon. The
          game, originally named "Puck-Man", was inspired by the shape of a
          pizza with a slice missing and the Japanese phrase for the sound of
          chomping. Its non-violent, maze-chase format was a departure from the
          popular space shooters of the time and was designed to appeal to a
          broader audience.
