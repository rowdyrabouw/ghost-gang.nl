          <p class="dark">
            Pac-Man was created by Japanese designer Toru Iwatani and released
            by Namco in Japan in 1980, quickly becoming a global phenomenon. The
            game, originally named "Puck-Man", was inspired by the shape of a
            pizza with a slice missing and the Japanese phrase for the sound of
            chomping.
